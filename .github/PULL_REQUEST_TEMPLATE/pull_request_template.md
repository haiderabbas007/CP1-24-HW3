# Pull Request Templating for Beginners #
The most common way **YOU** will interact with, and submit material to any repository you work on is via a "Pull Request".
Now not just any old Pull Request will do however; because hard at work making sure your repository stays in tip top shape are the wonderful mantainers and reviewers whose task it is to review pull requests and maintain the repository so that they meet up to date regulatory standards.
If you follow this simple guide you too can be submitting Grade A pull requests that will have reviewers saying "Gee this pull request sure is swell. **Approved!**"

To ensure that your pull request is a real winner make sure it includes the following:
  - A ledgible title that describes what is contained withing the pull request.
  - A ledible description that goes into more details than your title what each file contained within the request is and does.
  - A reference to any currently open issues that pertain to your pull request.
  - And make sure to label and add a milestone to your pull request.

If you have followed these steps you're on your way to a successful pull request.

The general structure of your pull request should be the following:

    - Within should contain:
    - Two or more seperate module files containing your function algorithms titled after each, and the appropriate docstrings.
    - One or more files containing the unit tests for your algorithms an the appropriate unit test title.
    - Finally for clarity you can add a helful README.md that further describes your algorithms, their tests, and how to run them.
   
With this you now have the makings of a solid and respectable pull request.
