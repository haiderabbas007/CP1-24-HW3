# EM Waves in Conductors

Maxwell's equations can be used to model the behavior of EM waves in conductors.

1. $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{\epsilon} \rho_f$$

2. $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$

3. $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$

4. $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu \sigma \mathbf{E} + \mu \epsilon \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$

Using the continuity equation for free charge, Ohm's Law, and Gauss's Law, it can be shown that any initial free charge $\rho_f(0)$ dissipates in a **characteristic time** $\tau \equiv \epsilon / \sigma$. This is what we mean when we say that any excess charge deposited on a conductor resides on its surface. Of course, it takes a finite time for the excess charges to migrate to the surface. The shorter the characteristic time, the better the conductor.

Once any accumulated charges have disappeared, Maxwell's equations are simplified to:

1. $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$$

2. $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$

3. $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$

4. $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu \sigma \mathbf{E} + \mu \epsilon \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$
